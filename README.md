# UMD Gym
UMD Gym is an iOS application for checking the capacity of various gyms and weight rooms at the University of Maryland, College Park. It was commissioned by Larry Steele, a student at UMD.

It pulls from the [University Recreation and Wellness API](http://recwell.umd.edu/wwwnet/formsite/api/count/GetAreaUsages) used by their [official facilities monitoring website](http://recwell.umd.edu/Facilities/Indoor-Facilities).
